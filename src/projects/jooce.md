Status: _abandoned_

[jooce](https://github.com/FiniteMonkeys/jooce) is an Elixir library that interfaces with
[kRPC](https://github.com/krpc/krpc) to control spacecraft in
[Kerbal Space Program](https://kerbalspaceprogram.com/) with Elixir code.

Not long after jooce reached its current state,
[Adrian Irving-Beer](https://github.com/wisq) came out with
[space_ex](https://github.com/wisq/space_ex), which is both
a more complete implementation of the kRPC API and a better Elixir library.
As a result, further development of jooce has been suspended.

> Remember, kids: don't be afraid to abandon your own code for something better.

There is some interesting code in jooce for manipulating binaries and
interfacing with [protocol buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/).
The jooce repository will be kept around in case that code becomes useful in the future.
