[Kerbal Maps](https://github.com/FiniteMonkeys/kerbal-maps) is...
think [Google Maps](https://maps.google.com/), but for the planetary bodies in
[Kerbal Space Program](https://kerbalspaceprogram.com/).

This isn't a new idea. [kerbalmaps.com](http://www.kerbalmaps.com/) did it first,
then went offline permanently.
[ksp.deringenieur.net](http://ksp.deringenieur.net) picked up the torch,
but there doesn't seem to have been any activity on that front in a couple of years.

Now, it's our turn.
